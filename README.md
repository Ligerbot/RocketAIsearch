# RocketAIsearch
An effective way to search the internet
# How it works
* RocketAIsearch uses the Google search API to gather 10 of the most relevant sources.
* This info is then fed into the LLM, which can be chosen by modifying the Python file.
__This project uses Ollama so the Ollama server must be running__
